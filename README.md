## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<p>The objective of this project was to improve and consolidate my knowledge about the technologies used, mainly the Google Vision Cloud API.

For now this its just a concept of what can be done using the Vision Cloud.

I utilized the Vision API to extract text from an image of an supermarket shelf label, to obtain information such as the name of the product and its price.
